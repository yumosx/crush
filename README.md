## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, or OpenRouter and just start
Crush. You'll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable       | Provider                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`        | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`           | OpenAI                                             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`       | OpenRouter                                         |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`           | Google Gemini                                      |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`        | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`             | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`        | AWS Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`    | AWS Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AWS_REGION`               | AWS Bedrock (Claude)                               |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`    | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), an community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

<a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk"><img width="174" height="174" alt="Catwalk Badge" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d" /></a>

## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `./.crush.json`
2. `./crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
   "this-setting": { }
   "that-setting": { }
}
```

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "lsp": {
    "go": {
      "command": "gopls"
    },
    "typescript": {
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    },
    "nix": {
      "command": "nil"
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "mcp": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "$(echo Bearer $EXAMPLE_MCP_TOKEN)"
      }
    },
    "streaming-service": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp/sse",
      "headers": {
        "API-Key": "$(echo $API_KEY)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don't want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Whitelisting Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you'd like, you can whitelist tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allowed_tools": [
      "view",
      "ls",
      "grep",
      "edit",
      "mcp_context7_get-library-doc"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don't forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": {
      "type": "openai",
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "deepseek-chat",
          "name": "Deepseek V3",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 0.27,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 1.1,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 0.07,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 1.1,
          "context_window": 64000,
          "default_max_tokens": 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "custom-anthropic": {
      "type": "anthropic",
      "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
      "api_key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
      "extra_headers": {
        "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01"
      },
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 3,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 15,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 3.75,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 0.3,
          "context_window": 200000,
          "default_max_tokens": 50000,
          "can_reason": true,
          "supports_attachments": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "debug": true,
    "debug_lsp": true
  }
}
```
